# Project Introduction

In the realm of machine learning and data analysis, the ability to classify and predict outcomes is crucial for informed decision-making. This project revolves around the evaluation of three different classifiers – Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting – across multiple datasets with variations in feature manipulation. The primary focus is on assessing the classifiers' performance through metrics such as **accuracy**, **ROC curves**, **AUC scores**, and **confusion matrices**.

## Problem Statement

Despite the prevalence of machine learning algorithms, choosing the most suitable classifier for a given dataset remains a challenge. This project addresses the need for a comprehensive evaluation of classifiers across diverse datasets, including those with rank-swapped, all columns swapped, and non-swapped features. The specific problem is to understand how these classifiers perform under various data conditions, facilitating a better-informed selection of classifiers for different scenarios.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is multifold. Firstly, it aims to provide a comparative analysis of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting classifiers on datasets exhibiting different characteristics. This analysis involves assessing the classifiers' accuracy, their ability to handle feature manipulations, and their performance in predicting outcomes.

Secondly, the project seeks to explore the impact of dataset cleaning on classifier performance. By comparing results on both original and cleaned datasets, it aims to highlight the significance of data preprocessing in improving classifier accuracy and robustness.

Lastly, this project serves the purpose of guiding practitioners and researchers in selecting the most appropriate classifier for specific use cases. The insights gained from this evaluation can inform decisions on classifier adoption based on the nature of the dataset, potentially improving the efficiency and reliability of machine learning models in practical applications.
